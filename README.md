## HTML Document Structure
An HTML document follows a specific structure, encompassing the following main components:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This isn't an HTML tag per se, but it's a crucial part of every HTML file. It instructs the web browser about the HTML version being used in the document.

- `<html>`: This is the root element of your HTML page. It contains all other HTML elements (tags).

- `<head>`: This tag is used to include non-visual information about the webpage, like meta-information, links to CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

- `<title>`: The title tag defines the title of the webpage, which is displayed on the tab bar of the browser.

- `<body>`: This is where you'll include the main content of your webpage, such as text, images, videos, links, tables, lists, and more.

## Headers and Paragraphs
Headers and paragraphs are used to structure and style the text on your webpage:

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: HTML provides six different levels of headings to structure your content. `<h1>` is the highest level (usually the most important and largest text), and `<h6>` is the lowest.

- `<p>`: The paragraph tag is used to display blocks of text. The browser automatically adds some margin before and after a paragraph for better readability.


## Semantic Elements
Semantic elements bring meaning to your HTML structure, helping both the user and the search engine understand the content of different parts of your webpage:

- `<header>`: This tag is used for the container of introductory content or a set of navigational links. You would usually place your site logo and main navigation menu inside the `<header>`.

- `<footer>`: The `<footer>` tag is used to define the bottom of a webpage or a section. It typically contains information about the author, copyright notices, links to privacy policy, etc.

- `<article>`: This tag represents an independent, self-contained block of related content. For example, a blog post or a user comment can be put inside an `<article>` tag.

- `<section>`: The `<section>` tag is used to group related content together, often introduced by a heading. It helps to structure the webpage in a meaningful way.
